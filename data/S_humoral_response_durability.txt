# In a prospective study of 107 hospitalized patients, decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming 
# negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the 
# ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months (last of two samples taken) 
# in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.

# 27yo female nurse reinfected in December 2020 (B.1.177) after initial infection in March 2020 (B.3), i.e. with a 
# 9 month interval. Both cases were mild.
# No significant differences in the neutralizing capacity of the two lineages were observed in 4 sera taken (1 pre-reinfection, 
# three post-reinfection). Neutralizing antibody titres (IC50) before and immediately after re-infection were <300 against 
# both strains, and jumped >7x upon re-infection. Viral titres were also higher in the second case.
# Second case also includes N:p.A220V
