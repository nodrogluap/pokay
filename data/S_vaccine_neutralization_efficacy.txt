# Using a lentivirus virus pseudotyped with D614G Spike, sera from vaccinated individuals who received the second dose (9–11 days post-second dose of Pfizer) exhibited a robust 
# neutralizing potential, with a mean NT50 value of 99,000. This was an average of a 2-fold increase, relative to sera drawn from the 
# individuals who received one dose of vaccination—mean NT50 dilution of 51,300. Importantly, a 6-fold increase in mean NT50 dilution was

# Vaccination of health care workers in Delhi was started in early 2021, with the ChdOx-1 (Astra Zeneca)
# vaccine. Surveillance has suggested B.1.1.7 dominance in the Delhi area during early 2021,
# with growth of B.1.617 since March 2021. During the wave of
# infections during March and April an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 33 vaccinated staff

# 16/33 were B.1.617.2, with a range of other B lineage viruses including B.1.1.7 for the rest except one A lineage case.
