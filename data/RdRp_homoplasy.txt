# No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness was presumed.

# PG: Effect is synonymous (Y454=), with the reference contig containing the optimal human codon (UAC) vs this variant (UAU).
# PG: Has lead to two major lineage expansions and number fizzle-outs, accessible loop base in a stem-loop RNA secondary structure. 
# PG: The homoplasy may be due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a fitness advantage.
