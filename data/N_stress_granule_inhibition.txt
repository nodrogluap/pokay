# Stress granules (SGs) are ephermeral cellular structures that temporarily place mRNAs in a translationally inactive state while cells are stress.  
# Not surprisingly, viruses can modulate SG formation in infected cells through interactions with SG effector proteins.
# Methylation of N protein at R95 causes the suppression of SG formation through host-protein interactions.
