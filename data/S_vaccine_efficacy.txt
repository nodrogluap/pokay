# In sera from 17 sero-positive blood donors, and 18 months post-infection (May 2020) sera from 17 health 
# care workers in Sweden, a 40x drop in neutralization by Omicron (B.1.1.529) pseudotyped lentivirus 
# was observed in HEK293T cells using the First WHO International Standard (20/136). Median IC50 reduction
# was ~6x for the blood donors, and ~4.5x for the health care workers.

# In a 1:5 test-negative matched control study of 8153 individuals who received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, 2027 test-positive cases were Delta.
# Two dose vaccine efficacy against Delta decreased from 94.1% (90.5-96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% 
# (70.2-86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-Delta variants. VE against Delta 
# was lower among individuals aged ≥65 years (75.2% [59.6-84.8%]) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9% [85.5-89.9%]). 
# VE against Delta hospitalization was 97.6% (92.8-99.2%). One-dose VE was 77.0% (60.7-86.5%) against Delta infection.

# In Minnesota in July 2020 (when Delta variant prevalence was >70%), the effectiveness against infection for mRNA-1273 was estimated at 76% 
# (95% CI: 58-87%) using age, sex, race, PCR testing and vaccination date matched cohorts of unvaccinated, Pfizer and Moderna vaccinees. 
# An even more pronounced reduction in effectiveness was observed for BNT162b2 of 42% (95% CI: 13-62%). 
# mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64).
# In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination 
# with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62).

# (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. 
# With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. 
# With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant.

# During December 14, 2020–August 14, 2021, frontline worker without previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were monitored regularly. 
# Of 4,217 participants, 3,483 (83%) were vaccinated; 2,278 (65%) received Pfizer-BioNTech, 1,138 (33%) Moderna, and 67 (2%) Janssen 
# (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines.
# Adjusted VE during this Delta predominant period was 66% (95% CI = 26%–84%) compared with 91% (95% CI = 81%–96%) during the 
# months preceding Delta predominance.
# This trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of 
# poor precision in estimates due to limited number of weeks of observation and few infections among participants. As with all observational VE 
# studies, unmeasured and residual confounding might be present.

# Two doses of mRNA vaccines were 74.7% effective against infection among nursing home residents early in the vaccination program

# Using a test-negative design using Ontario data between Dec 14, 2020 and May 30, 2021, 421,073 symptomatic community-dwelling individuals were tested.
# Against Delta, vaccine effectiveness after partial vaccination tended to be lower compared to Alpha for mRNA-1273 (72% vs. 83%) and BNT162b2 (56% vs. 66%), 
# but was similar to Alpha for ChAdOx1 (67% vs. 64%). Full vaccination with BNT162b2 increased protection against Delta (87%) to levels comparable to 
# Alpha (89%) and Beta/Gamma (84%). Delta-positive cases were biased towards young male residents of the Peel region.

# Using a matched test-negative, case- control study design in Qatar, BNT162b2 effectiveness against any Delta infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, 
# was 64.2% (95% CI: 38.1-80.1%) ≥14 days after the first dose and before the second dose, but was only 53.5% (95% CI: 43.9-61.4%) ≥14 days after the 
# second dose, in a population in which a large proportion of fully vaccinated persons received their second dose several months earlier. 
# Corresponding effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0% (95% CI: 58.9-90.1%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 75.9-90.8%), respectively. Effectiveness against any
# severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7% (95% CI: 61.0-98.1%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0% (95% CI: 41.2-100.0%) for 
# mRNA-1273, ≥14 days after the second dose.
# The lower VE in Qatar relative to those reported in some other jurisdictions such as the UK and Canada (75%+) may reflect waning of vaccine protection for 
# those who received their second dose by end of 2020 or early 2021. Risk perception and behaviour amongst vaccinated individuals opver time may also 
# play a role.
