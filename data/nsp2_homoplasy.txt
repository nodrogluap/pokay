# No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness is presumed.
# PG: Effect is synonymous (S369=), with the reference contig containing the optimal human codon (UCC) vs this variant (UCU).
# PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansions, nor is it critical to a well defined RNA secondary structure. 
# PG: Presumably the homoplasy is due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a fitness advantage.
