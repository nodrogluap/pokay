# A 47yo Indian male was reinfected with B.1.36 lineage virus in September 2020 after infection with genetically distinct B.1.36 virus in 
# July, with negative PCR tests in between. While the forst episode was asymptomatic, the second included fever, cough, and malaise. 
# The second case additionally contained stopgain ORF3a:E261*

# A 42yo Iranian male was reinfected with B.1.36 lineage virus 128 days after infection with genetically distinct B.1.36 virus, with negative PCR tests in between.
# In the first instance patient presented with cough, headache, severe diarrhea. In the second instance symptoms were more severe:
# body pain, shortness of breath, headache and anosmia. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM tests were negative after both episodes. [Non-seroconversion
# may be associated with elevated risk of re-infection]

# 36920 COVID Symptom Study app users reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in late 2020. Possible reinfections were

# but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants.

# Hamsters re-infected with B.1.351 virus after seroversion from previous infection with a lineage A virus did not transmit 
# virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. They had little 
# infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs.
# Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351, but prevents disease and onward transmission.

# Partial sequencing of S gene reveals two cases of probable early 2021 B.1.1.7 lineage reinfection from non-B.1.1.7 original cases
# in Lombardy, with 45 to 90 days between infections (less than the typical 90 day guideline for this call).
# Patients were 56 and 58yo, immunocompenent, with one a former smoker with obesity and dyslipidemia. One case required intubation during first infection, 
# but presented with mild symptoms upon reinfection. The other case convalesced at home during the first episode, but required CPAP support 
# in the subacute clinical unit upon reinfection.
