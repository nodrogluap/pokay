# The L18F and D80A of the B.1.351 lineage lead to reconfiguration of the N-terminal segment despite the disulfide between
# Cys16 and Cys136 that partly anchors the N-terminal peptide. The most consequential changes are probably from the triple residue deletion...
# which causes a shift of the nearby loop 144-155 and must also reconfigure the adjacent disorder
# loop (residues 246-260), both of which form part of the neutralizing epitopes...bringing large changes in the antigenic surface in this
# region.
