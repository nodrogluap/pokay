# Remdesivir failure with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase mutation in a B-cell immunodeficient patient with protracted Covid-19
# We report the occurrence of a mutation in the RdRP (D484Y) following failure of remdesivir in a 76-year-old woman with a post-rituximab B-cell immunodeficiency and persistent SARSCoV
-2 viremia.

# Confers significant (5x) resistance in vitro to remdesivir [coordinates mapped from reported V553L in murine hepatitis virus model experiment to SARS-CoV-2].

# V556L mutation (incorrectly listed as V557L in the paper) is implicated in low-level resistance to Remdesivir.

# S861G mutation (incorrectly listed as S861G in the paper) in RdRp eliminates chain-termination by Remdesivir, 
# which confirms the existence of a steric clash between that residue and the incorporated RDV-TP
