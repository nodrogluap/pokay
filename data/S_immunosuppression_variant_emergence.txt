# The so-called "delta F" variant combination previously observed in mink spillover events also emerged in a lymphoma 
# patient (non-Hodgkin diffuse B-cell lymphoma IV stage B) with a long-term COVID-19 infection (4 months) where 18 de novo mutation occureed overall.
# Patient was taking rituximab, the B-cell-depleting agent, and had no detectable neutralizing antibody response.

# Appeared (day 75) and persisted in chronic (152 day) SARS-CoV-2 infection of immunoicompromised patient with severe antiphospholipid syndrome
# Appeared at same time as T478K,S494P but listed separately due to distance and different domains affected in the Spike (i.e. putatively an independent
# mutation from a functional standpoint since the former are from S1, the latter from S2).

# The delH69/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change [with which it is found in lineage B.1.1.7]
# Possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7.
