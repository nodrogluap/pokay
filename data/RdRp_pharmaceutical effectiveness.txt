# This mutation combination (with construct P323L on a D614G wildtype backbone), 
# is the only one present after 17 passages
# in 10uM remdesivir. V166L is outside the active polymerase site. 
# EC50 in a plaque reduction assay was 2.3x in the passage experiment, but only 1.5x when introduced
# on a WA1 backbone and measured using a luciferase assay.

# This mutation (discovered in a immunocomprimised patient with protracted COVID-19 given remdesivir) is associated with a ~6-fold in remdesivir IC50. 
# (i.e. increased resistance to treatment) in vitro, at some cost to viral fitness otherwise.
# Gandhi et al. (2021) https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.08.21266069v1
# Report a 2.5x reduction in remdesivir EC50 in the presence of this mutation.

# Remdesivir failure with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase mutation in a B-cell immunodeficient patient with protracted Covid-19

# S861G mutation (incorrectly listed as S861G in the paper) in RdRp eliminates chain-termination by Remdesivir,
