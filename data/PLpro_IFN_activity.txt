# Relative to Germany/BavPat1/2020 (early B lineage), 8 to 122-fold IFN-I response resistance was observed (as measured by 17 IFNs) 
# for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
# The B.1.1.7 strain exhibiting the highest IFN-I resistance at 122-fold (compare to 8x for B.1.351, 17x for B.1). The level of B.1.1.7 interferon 
# resistance was more striking when compared to USA-WA1/2020 (322-fold). 
# [changes noted as 112x in figure, 122x in text. Addition of A1305V from UK B.1.1.7 replicate has minimal effect. Replication 
# effects and IFN resistence cannot be readily distinguished in the assays used. Effect of lineage mutations in other genes may be important as well/instead]
