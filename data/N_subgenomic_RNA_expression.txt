# A noncanonical subgenomic RNA which could represent ORF9b is significantly enriched (~16x) in B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 
# potentially as a result of a triple nucleotide mutation leading to amino acid substitution D3L 
# in nucleocapsid in this lineage which increases complementarity with the genomic leader sequence.

D3L

# This variant, likely arisen by homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS) of the leader transcription-regulating
# sequence (TRS), generate a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript for the C-terminal dimerization domain. It may also have increased
# expression of sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames, based on public data analysis.

# This variant shows a significant increase in viral load compared to wild type, but not relative to D614G viruses without the variant
# in circulating viruses in the Spring of 2020 in Saudia Arabia.
