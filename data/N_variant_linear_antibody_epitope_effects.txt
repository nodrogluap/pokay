# At the epitope level, the D3L mutation reduces PIWAS signal in 1.5% of COVID patients (outliers reduce from 2.1% in wild type to 0.5% in mutant).
# In 3 of these patients (0.5% of the population), that alteration represents the strongest antigen signal and substantially reduces the PIWAS antigen score.
# In the B1.1.7 lineage this is largely counteracted by the S235F mutation, which increases epitope and antigen scores significantly in two individuals, for a net neutral effect at the population level.

D3L

# Substantially increases epitope and antigen scores in 2 of 579 individuals (should increase immune response).
# In the B1.1.7 lineage this is largely counteracted by the D3L mutation, which decreases PIWAS signal significantly in 1.5% of COVID patients, for a net neutral effect at the population level.
